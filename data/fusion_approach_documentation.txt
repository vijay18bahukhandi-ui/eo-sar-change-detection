
DATA FUSION APPROACH DOCUMENTATION
===================================

PURPOSE:
--------
Integrate complementary information from optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1)
data to enhance change detection capabilities and reduce limitations of single-sensor analysis.

FUSION METHODS IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------------

1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Fusion:
   - Technique: Statistical transformation to orthogonal components
   - Process: 
     * Stack optical and SAR data
     * Compute principal components
     * Use first principal component representing maximum variance
   - Advantages: Preserves maximum information from both sensors
   - Limitations: May not preserve spatial details perfectly

2. Brovey Transform Fusion:
   - Technique: Spectral preservation with SAR texture injection
   - Formula: Fused = (Optical × SAR) / (Optical + SAR)
   - Advantages: Simple, computationally efficient, preserves spectral information
   - Limitations: May introduce color distortion

3. Wavelet-Based Fusion:
   - Technique: Multi-resolution analysis using frequency domains
   - Process:
     * Decompose images using Gaussian pyramid
     * Combine low-frequency (average) and high-frequency (maximum) components
     * Reconstruct fused image
   - Advantages: Preserves both spectral and spatial information
   - Limitations: More computationally intensive

JUSTIFICATION FOR FUSION:
------------------------
• Optical Data Strengths: Rich spectral information, intuitive interpretation
• SAR Data Strengths: All-weather capability, surface texture, penetration
• Combined Benefits: 
  - Better change detection in cloudy conditions
  - Enhanced feature discrimination
  - Reduced false positives/negatives
  - Complementary information for urban and vegetation monitoring

APPLICATION TO CHANGE DETECTION:
-------------------------------
Fused data provides:
1. Robust urban change detection (buildings appear in both optical and SAR)
2. Improved vegetation monitoring (optical NDVI + SAR texture)
3. All-weather capability (SAR fills optical gaps during clouds)
4. Enhanced feature discrimination (combined spectral and structural info)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
• Use PCA fusion for maximum information preservation
• Use Brovey for computational efficiency
• Use Wavelet for high-quality spatial-spectral fusion
• Validate fusion quality with ground truth when available

LIMITATIONS:
-----------
• Requires coregistered input data
• Fusion artifacts possible in heterogeneous areas
• Computational overhead for large datasets
