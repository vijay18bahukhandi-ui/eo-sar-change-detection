
CHANGE DETECTION METHODOLOGY DOCUMENTATION
===========================================

METHODS IMPLEMENTED:
-------------------

1. Optical-Only Change Detection:
   - Image Differencing: |Image1 - Image2| > threshold
   - PCA Change Detection: Second principal component highlights changes
   - Index-based: NDVI for vegetation, NDBI for urban areas

2. SAR-Only Change Detection:
   - Ratio Method: log(Image1 / Image2), threshold on absolute value
   - Advantages: All-weather capability, sensitive to structural changes

3. Cross-Sensor Change Detection:
   - Weighted Fusion: 60% optical + 40% SAR confidence
   - Benefits: Combines spectral (optical) and structural (SAR) sensitivity

PARAMETERS AND THRESHOLDS:
-------------------------
• Optical Differencing: threshold = 0.2 (20% reflectance change)
• SAR Ratio: threshold = 0.5 (log ratio magnitude)
• NDVI Change: threshold = 0.2 (vegetation index change)
• NDBI Change: threshold = 0.1 (built-up index change)
• Cross-Sensor: optical_weight = 0.6, sar_weight = 0.4

POST-PROCESSING:
---------------
• Morphological Cleaning: Remove small noise pixels
• Opening/Closing: 3x3 structuring element
• Minimum Object Size: 10 pixels

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS RESULTS:
---------------------------
Based on the sample data analysis:

• Optical-Only: 4.00 km² changed (4.0%)
  - Pros: Good for spectral changes, intuitive interpretation
  - Cons: Affected by clouds, atmospheric conditions

• SAR-Only: 10.11 km² changed (10.1%)
  - Pros: All-weather, sensitive to moisture and structure
  - Cons: Speckle noise, less intuitive

• Cross-Sensor: 4.00 km² changed (4.0%)
  - Pros: Combines strengths of both sensors
  - Cons: More complex, requires coregistration

VALIDATION APPROACH:
------------------
• Visual inspection of change maps
• Consistency check across methods
• Statistical analysis of change magnitudes
• Comparison with known ground changes (when available)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
• Use cross-sensor approach for robust change detection
• Validate with multiple methods for confidence
• Consider seasonal variations in threshold selection
• Implement machine learning for adaptive thresholding

LIMITATIONS:
-----------
• Simplified threshold-based approach
• Sample data used for demonstration
• No atmospheric correction for optical data
• Basic speckle filtering for SAR data
